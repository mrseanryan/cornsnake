# cornsnake [{version}]

A small library wrapping common Python utilities for working with files, lists, processes, dates and times.

Functions that I find myself writing time and again, on various OSS and personal projects - so collecting in one place, in case it is of use!

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12 or higher

```
pip install fitz
```

- fitz is for PDF parsing
