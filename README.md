# cornsnake

A small library wrapping common Python utilities for working with files, lists, processes, dates and times.

Functions that I find myself writing time and again, on various OSS and personal projects - so collecting in one place, in case it is of use!

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12 or higher

```
pip install fitz parameterized
```

- fitz is for PDF parsing
- parameterized is for unit tests only

## Unit Tests

```
python -m unittest  
```

OR:

```
test.unit.bat
```
