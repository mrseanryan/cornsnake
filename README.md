# cornsnake

A small library wrapping common Python utilities for working with files, git, ZIP, lists, processes, dates and times.

Functions that I find myself writing time and again, on various OSS and personal projects - so collecting in one place, in case it is of use!

## Install

```
python -m pip install --upgrade cornsnake
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12 or higher

```
pip install PyMuPDF
```

- fitz is for PDF parsing (installed as PyMuPDF)

## Usage

Functions are organised in logical groups like `util_file` or `util_print`.

To see what funcations are available, see the [source code](https://github.com/mrseanryan/cornsnake/tree/master/src/cornsnake).

For an example, see the [e2e tests](https://github.com/mrseanryan/cornsnake/tree/master/e2e).
